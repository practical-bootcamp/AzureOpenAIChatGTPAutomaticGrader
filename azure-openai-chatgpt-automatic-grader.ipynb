Also include setting up the equipment needed for some project, for example, HKEAA DSE related works.\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging user accounts\\n\\nCreating and managing user accounts for projects, which involves setting up new accounts, disabling old accounts, and managing access permissions. I assisted in this area for OpenData Hackathon 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging help desk services\\n\\nI need to call our own outsourced help desk, ensuring that the service quality is good and efficient. Then write a report for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDocumenting and tracking issues\\n\\nI need to document issues and resolution, as well as track the progress of issues to ensure they are resolved in a timely manner.\\n\\nMy job role in the workplace is to provide technical support. I am responsible for ensuring that users have the tools and resources they need to perform their jobs effectively, which is crucial for maintaining productivity and efficiency.\\n\\nThe support team leader influenced my approach to my job duty the most, since he is the one helping to guide me through my work.\\n\\nGaining valuable experience, getting used to teamwork, building my skills, and making a positive contribution to the workplace makes me feel good about being a staff member there.\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkplace experience\\n\\nThe best experience I get is learning how to work effectively in a team. By focusing on effective communication, defining roles and responsibilities, establishing goals and objectives, encouraging collaboration and being adaptable, it helps me develop my teamwork skills and be a more effective team member in the workplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most memorable experience I have is helping to build a racing/driving simulator set in the office. lol\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning in Workplace\\n\\nDuring the internship period, I learned more about GCP and Azure. More on BigQuery and Terraform. Also learned how to work as a team and ways to better organize my work and time. Most of the skills I use and learn are related to the program I study.\\n\\n\\n\\nComments on Workplace and Suggestions\\n\\nWorkplace is very Google style. Chill and nice. Thereâ€™s PS5, racing/driving simulator, gym set and a lot of other stuff for fun. I like it.\\n\\nOne suggestion I can make is to add more desks to the office so staff donâ€™t have to move around as much.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout WLA\\n\\nWLA went smooth for me and everything I have learnt through school or workplace did help my WLA.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nI feel like I did well enough during the internship. If I give a mark to myself, it would be around 75/100. Could always be better.\\n\\nAs for achievement, I would see helping the hosting of OpenData Hackathon 2022 as one. lol\\n\\nI work accurately and efficiently, and my supervisor and colleagues usually would like to let me help or handle some of the work.\\n\\n\\n\\nCareer Path\\n\\nI want to keep myself on the career path of being a cloud engineer, so I will continue to learn more related topics and keep myself good in the industry.'"
