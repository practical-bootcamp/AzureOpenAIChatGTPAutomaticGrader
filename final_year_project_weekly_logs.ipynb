However, it's concerning that there were multiple weeks where no progress was made. Keep in mind that consistency is key for a successful project. You showed effort in contributing to the project, but it would be beneficial to showcase more progress. The logs could've been structured more clearly, with some entries lacking adequate information. Technical tasks seem to have been attempted, but there is room for further improvement. Based on the rubric, 20 marks were given for consistently working on the project, 10 marks for meeting the required number of logs, 16 marks for contribution to the project, 10 marks for progress shown, 4 marks for coherence and cohesion in the logs, and 5 marks for done technical tasks. Since there were 6 weeks with no progress, one mark was deducted. Overall, you've done a decent job, and I encourage you to keep up the good work and strive for more consistency and progress in the coming weeks.\", 'noOfWeekDoingNothing': 6, 'tokens': 1459, 'error': False}\n",

However, there were a few weeks where there was no progress made, which resulted in a deduction of marks. It is important to stay consistent throughout the project to ultimately succeed. The log entries were adequate, and there were at least 20 entries made. The contribution and progress made in the project were decent, resulting in marks being awarded. There was coherence and cohesion in the log entries. Technical tasks were done, with Terraform, chatbox with OpenAI, and building table storage to store account being some of the notable ones. The final mark of 55 was determined by the above factors. Keep up the good work and continue to put effort into the project to see it through to completion.', 'noOfWeekDoingNothing': 6, 'tokens': 1365, 'error': False}\n"
